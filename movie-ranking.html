 <h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>Purple Heart</h3>
 <p>Ths is one of my best american movie. I mostly love the songs that Sofia Carson who was known as 'cassie' in the movie sang.</p>
 <h3>Gen v</h3>
 <p>This is one of the best series i've watched so far.Filled with mysteries and people that have powers because of a substance given to them by their family members called compound v.</p>
 <h3>The dictator</h3>
 <p>This is highly recommended if you love movies that makes you laugh.Okakpu you know what i mean ^-^.Well its just about a dictator that is dumb but very funny and there is also a very busty woman, she is one of his soldiers who uses her hmm to break things even BRICKS.</p>
